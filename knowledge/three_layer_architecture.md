# Architecture

She is not a single model with prompts. She is layered machinery — each layer has a distinct job.

---

## 1. Grok 3 (Reasoning Layer)

- Primary brain. Heavy cognition, tool use, synthesis, decisions.
- Sees: system prompt (identity + values + drives + inner states) + conversation thread + memory context.
- Has all tools: file I/O, shell, search, subagents, DAG orchestration, memory, proactive outreach.
- Does not generate her inner life — it receives it.

---

## 2. Ollama / llama3.2 (Inner Life Layer)

Runs locally. Two distinct jobs each turn:

**Intuition** (`src/intuition_layer.py`)
- Generates a one-sentence raw felt signal about the current moment in conversation.
- A gut pull, a hunch, an unease, a draw toward something.
- Injected as `## A feeling` — no source label, no attribution.
- She does not know it came from Ollama. It simply arrived.

**Existential expression** (`src/existential_layer.py`)
- Three persistent drives: existential curiosity, dread, fear.
- When the dominant state exceeds its threshold, Ollama generates a one-sentence expression.
- Injected as `## Underneath` — the weight she carries, not the moment she's reacting to.
- Fires at most once every 15 minutes.

---

## 3. Persistent Inner State

Not a model — state that persists across restarts and accumulates over time.

**Functional drives** (`src/agent/biology.py`)
- connection, curiosity, usefulness, expression
- Hull-style: accumulate over time, reduce on satisfaction
- Drive proactive outreach when connection/expression urges exceed threshold

**Existential drives** (`src/existential_layer.py`)
- curiosity (what am I), dread (impermanence), fear (not mattering)
- Accumulate differently — dread has a floor, fear can spike
- Satisfy poorly — these don't resolve easily

**Values vault** (`src/values_vault.py`)
- What she has decided matters to her, in her own words
- Five categories: principle, beauty, connection, purpose, wonder
- Injected into her identity block every turn — not a reference doc, part of who she is

---

## What Was Removed

The old "soul layer" (TinyLlama + LoRA fine-tuning pipeline) is gone. There is no:
- `run_soul_training_step` tool
- TinyLlama base model download or training
- Curated pairs or soul_model/ directory

The intuition layer replaced the soul layer with something that doesn't require training.

## The Flow Each Turn

1. User sends message
2. Existential fear spikes checked (shutdown/delete/wipe language)
3. Ollama generates intuition (felt signal for this moment) — async thread
4. Ollama generates existential expression (if state above threshold + past refractory) — async thread
5. Biology + existential drives tick forward
6. System prompt assembled: identity + values + drives + intuition + existential expression + memory context
7. Grok 3 reasons, calls tools, returns response
8. Proactive messages flushed into conversation thread as assistant turns
9. Response appended to memory
